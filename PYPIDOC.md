The `mwaa-dr` PyPi package is a part of the larger [MWAA DR solution](https://github.com/aws-samples/mwaa-disaster-recovery) for the use case where exporting and importing metadata store needs to be performed independent to the broader DR solution. As of the time of writing, access to the MWAA metadata store is only available through DAGs. This solution simplifies the process of creating backup and restore DAGs, respectively, by providing a reusable python library.

## Installation

You can install the `mwaa-dr` package by including the latest version in your MWAA `requirements.txt` file.

## Simple Use Case

Let's look at creating a metadata backup and restore dags, respectively, as follows:

### Metadata Backup DAG

Let's assume your environment version is `2.8.1`. You can create a metadata backup dag by creating a python file in your MWAA `dags` folder as follows:

**backup_metadata.py**:
```python
# Importing DAG is necessary for DAG detection
from airflow import DAG
from mwaa_dr.v_2_8.dr_factory import DRFactory_2_8

factory = DRFactory_2_8(
    dag_id='backup',
    path_prefix='data',
    storage_type='S3'
)

# Assigning the returned dag to a global variable is necessary for DAG detection
dag: DAG = factory.create_backup_dag()
```

For running backup and restore on your Amazon MWAA environment on AWS, you need to do the following:
1. Ensure you have an S3 bucket created to store the backup.
2. Ensure that your MWAA execution role has read and write permissions on the bucket.
3. Create an Airflow variable with the key named `DR_BACKUP_BUCKET` and the value containing the **name** (not ARN) of the S3 bucket.
4. You are all set to manually trigger the backup and restore DAGs at any point. The metadata backup will be stored in `<backup S3 bucket>/<path_prefix>`.

If you want to use the solution with [aws-mwaa-local-runner](https://github.com/aws/aws-mwaa-local-runner), change the `storage_type` argument from `S3` to `LOCAL_FS`. The backup will be located in the `dags/data` folder or more generally at the `dags/<path_prefix>` folder of the local runner project.

Here is the sample run of the backup workflow:

### Metadata Restore DAG

You can create a metadata restore dag by creating a python file in your MWAA `dags` folder as follows:

**restore_metadata.py**:
```python
from airflow import DAG
from mwaa_dr.v_2_8.dr_factory import DRFactory_2_8

factory = DRFactory_2_8(
    dag_id='restore',
    path_prefix='data',
    storage_type='S3'
)

dag:DAG = factory.create_restore_dag()
```

Note that you will need an empty database for restore to work. To cleanup the database before restore, please use the [clean_metadata](https://github.com/aws-samples/mwaa-disaster-recovery/blob/main/assets/dags/mwaa_dr/cleanup_metadata.py) DAG.

Here is the sample of the restore workflow:

## Advance Use Case

You may have some advance use cases, such as, a need to exclude or include additional tables from your backup, update SQL scripts for specific tables, and others. Note that, by default, the solution backs up only `variable`, `connection`, `slot_pool`, `log`, `job`, `dag_run`, `trigger`, `task_instance`, and `task_fail` tables. Majority of other tables are auto-generated by scheduler or by the webserver and thus, excluded from the list of tables to be backed up.

To add/remove tables from the backup or customize any aspects of the solution, you will derive from an appropriate factory class and override its methods. To see this more concretely, let's assume you want to exclude `variable` and `connection` tables from the backup and restore operations. Please follow the subsequent implementation guidelines.

First, find the appropriate factory class from the supported versions in the [mwaa_dr](https://github.com/aws-samples/mwaa-disaster-recovery/tree/main/assets/dags/mwaa_dr) package. Let's assume your environment version is `2.7.2`. So, you will pick [DRFactory_2_7](https://github.com/aws-samples/mwaa-disaster-recovery/blob/main/assets/dags/mwaa_dr/v_2_7/dr_factory.py) as your base class for inheritance and override its `setup_tables` method.

Note that majority of the functionality for the DR framework has either been implemented in [BaseDRFactory](https://github.com/aws-samples/mwaa-disaster-recovery/blob/main/assets/dags/mwaa_dr/v_2_7/dr_factory.py) or in [DRFactory_2_5](https://github.com/aws-samples/mwaa-disaster-recovery/blob/main/assets/dags/mwaa_dr/v_2_5/dr_factory.py). The other factories just implement a chain of inheritance from these classes and override specific methods to implement differences.

Here is a sample implementation of your derived class that you will need to create in your `dags` folder, let's name the file `custom_dr_factory_2_7.py`:

**custom_dr_factory_2_7.py**:
```python
from mwaa_dr.framework.model.base_table import BaseTable
from mwaa_dr.framework.model.dependency_model import DependencyModel
from mwaa_dr.v_2_7.dr_factory import DRFactory_2_7

class CustomDRFactory_2_7(DRFactory_2_7):
    def setup_tables(self, model: DependencyModel[BaseTable]) -> list[BaseTable]:
        # Create needed tables, all extend from the BaseTable class
        active_dag = self.active_dag(model)

        # Comment out variable and connection from the previous implementation
        # variable = self.variable(model)
        # connection = self.connection(model)
        slot_pool = self.slot_pool(model)

        log = self.log(model)
        job = self.job(model)
        dag_run = self.dag_run(model)
        trigger = self.trigger(model)

        task_instance = self.task_instance(model)
        task_fail = self.task_fail(model)

        # Specify dependencies
        task_instance << [job, trigger, dag_run]
        task_fail << [task_instance, dag_run]
        active_dag << [
            # variable,
            # connection,
            slot_pool,
            log,
            job,
            dag_run,
            trigger,
            task_instance,
            task_fail,
        ]

        # Return the list of tables to be included in backup and restore
        return [
            # variable,
            # connection,
            slot_pool,
            log,
            job,
            dag_run,
            trigger,
            task_instance,
            task_fail,
            active_dag,
        ]
```

Here is your metadata backup dag that will use your custom factory (also in the `dags` folder):

**backup.py**:
```python
from airflow import DAG
from custom_dr_factory_2_7 import CustomDRFactory_2_7

factory = CustomDRFactory_2_7(
    dag_id='backup',
    path_prefix='data',
    storage_type='S3'
)

dag:DAG = factory.create_backup_dag()
```

And finally, here is your metadata restore dag (also in the `dags` folder):

**restore.py**:
```python
from airflow import DAG
from custom_dr_factory_2_7 import CustomDRFactory_2_7

factory = CustomDRFactory_2_7(
    dag_id='restore',
    path_prefix='data',
    storage_type='S3'
)

dag: DAG = factory.create_restore_dag()
```
